# Distributed Systems Overview

## Characteristics

1. **Resource Sharing**: Nodes in the distributed system can share resources like data, processing power, and storage.
2. **Concurrency**: Multiple tasks can be executed simultaneously in a distributed system.
3. **Scalability**: It can easily accommodate the addition of more nodes to handle increasing loads.
4. **Fault Tolerance**: Failure of one node does not lead to the failure of the entire system.
5. **Transparency**: Users perceive the distributed system as a single coherent system, hiding the distribution of resources.
6. **Heterogeneity**: Nodes in the system may have different hardware, operating systems, and programming languages.

## Application Areas

1. **Finance and Commerce**: Online banking, stock trading platforms.
2. **Information Society**: Social media networks.
3. **Cloud Technology**: SAP (Systems, Applications, and Products in Data Processing) services.
4. **Entertainment**: Streaming platforms, online gaming.
5. **Healthcare**: Electronic medical records systems, telemedicine platforms.

## Advantages

1. Nodes can easily share data with each other.
2. Scalability allows for the addition of more nodes.
3. Fault tolerance ensures system reliability.
4. Resources like printers can be shared among multiple nodes.

## Disadvantages

1. Security can be challenging to ensure across all nodes and connections.
2. Data loss can occur during transmission between nodes.
3. Managing the database in a distributed system can be complex.
4. Network overloading may happen if all nodes attempt to send data simultaneously.

## Design Challenges

- **Network Creation**: Establishing connections between nodes.
- **Computer Hardware Compatibility**: Ensuring compatibility across different hardware configurations.
- **Operating Systems**: Handling diverse operating systems on various nodes.
- **Programming Languages**: Supporting different programming languages used by nodes.
- **Implementation Consistency**: Ensuring consistency in system implementation across different developers.
- **Openness**: Extensibility and re-implementation of the system with shared resources.
- **Security**: Protecting against unauthorized access, interference, and data alteration or corruption.
