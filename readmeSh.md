# React Redux with Redux Toolkit
## Redux

Redux is a state management library commonly used with React to manage the state of the application in a predictable way. It follows a unidirectional data flow and maintains a single source of truth for the entire application state.


## React-redux
React Redux is a popular library for managing state in React applications, and Redux Toolkit is a set of utility functions and abstractions designed to simplify the process of working with Redux.


## Redux Toolkit

Redux Toolkit is the recommended library for writing Redux logic. It includes utilities to simplify common Redux use cases, such as store setup, reducer creation, and immutable update logic.

Key features of Redux Toolkit:

- **createSlice**: Reducer and actions in one place.
- **configureStore**: Configure the Redux store with good defaults.
- **createAsyncThunk**: Handle asynchronous actions with ease.
- **createEntityAdapter**: Manage normalized data in the store.
